DEVELOPING KULINARIINDONESIA
----------------------------

1	Creating kulinariindonesia

	>	rails new kulinariindonesia

2	Running kulinariindonesia for the first time

	> cd kulinariindonesia
	> rails server
	DONE

3	Adding about and contact pages 

	> rails g controller Pages about contact

4	Adding navigations

	> <a href="/pages/about">About</a>
	  <a href="/pages/contact">Contact</a>

5	Moving the navigations from the about and contact pages
	to layouts/appication.html.erb

	> move them to that file


6 	Moving the copyright text (footer) to layouts/appication.html.erb

	> move it to that file


7	Adding Restaurants

	> rails g scaffold Restaurant name:string address:string phone:string website:string

	NOTE:

	-	The above instruction created a lot of files, of of them is 
		db/migrate.

		We call that file MIGRATION

	-	We added Restaurant, we need to have 
		database to store information about them.	

	-	We gave rails instruction of what data to store. 
		And this is called MIGRATION.	

	-	Any change made to the database, whether we add new field,
		or changing the existing field, we have to create a new migration.	

	-	The Migration, always need 3 steps proccess:
	
		1. 	Generate the migration on rails

		2.	rake db:migrate

			It is about to take the instruction from the migration and run them
			by creating database table or new columns that we wanted.

		3.	Re-run the server

	>> Test the browser

		> http://localhost:3000/restaurants/new


8	Set Up The Home Page

	>> In the routes files, add:

		>   root 'restaurants#index'

	>> Checking the route paths

		> rake routes
